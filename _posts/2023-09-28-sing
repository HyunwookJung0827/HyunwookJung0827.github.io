**3.5 / 5**
There were many humorous scenes. 
Overall enjoyable. 

One thing to point out is that every song in the final stage is exciting, and Meena, the shy elephant also picked an exciting song. 
Although the director was trying to represent the confidence, it was a little bit disappointing to not have various emotions. 
I would had enjoyed more if Meena sang an emotional/overwhelming song that can makes me cry.
For an exciting song, other characters had more fascinating voices, and nailed it in their parts in my opinion.
